Front end development helper

For front-end development an exact representation
of the data from the server helps minimize the
development cycle. For this to happen a server has to
be setup first, well that requires time. In this project a
JSON representation of the data is stored in a file which
is editable and is parsed and served by localhost.
Enabling BE and FE development in parallel.
